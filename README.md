Inspiration
My project is inspired by the 1977 film: Star Wars: A New
Hope. The scene I am depicting is when the "Millennium
Falcon" first launches off the planet of Tatooine. It seems
almost unbelievable that the scenes imagery holds up after
four decades. According to me, this proves that our
resources do not define our limitations. I hope you enjoy my
rendition.

About
The plants, the wall, the reappearance of the TIE fighters
and parts of the Millennium falcon itself are designed using
recursive functions, while Tatooine's two suns and the
flashing of lights use gaurds and custom colours.
Using the space bar you can launch the Millennium falcon or
give it a power boost. You can use the arrow keys to move
the spaceship around.

How to run it
1. To install the graphics library I'm using through stack, type
the following commands in the terminal:
stack update
Followed by,
stack install gloss 
2. Now “cd / “ to the directory in which the file NewHope.hs
is stored.
For Example- cd /Users/lambdaMan/Desktop/
3. To open the graphical interface, type the following
commands in the terminal:
stack ghc -- --make NewHope
Followed by,
./NewHope

4. This should open a window on the desktop with my
project on the Desktop. If the window displays a blank
screen try resizing the window slightly and it should work
(this was an error I encountered while testing my code on
another computer).
I have included an example of what the graphic should look
like in the folder. 
THANK YOU!
